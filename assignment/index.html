      Question: when writing the code for #7, I went back and forth on where within the function to put the 'return false;' statement. I submitted the assignment with the return statement outside of the conditional, but I also successfully tested it with the return statement as part of the conditional: ...else { return false; }.

     <br>
      Is one version better practice than the other?
